Virtual interviews come with their own set of challenges that go beyond typical interview nerves. After 16 years without interviewing, my recent experience brought to light some common virtual interview issues. I’m sharing these insights in hopes of helping others feel better prepared for similar situations.


# Key Virtual Interview Challenges and Tips:


## Unexpected Platform Changes 

My interview was supposed to be an audio meeting on Teams, where each person’s identity is clear. Instead, I found myself waiting in the virtual lobby only to receive a phone call instead. Without the clarity that Teams audio provides, it became difficult to distinguish voices or know who was speaking. 

Tip: If the platform changes unexpectedly, politely request clarification or even ask to reschedule if the new platform hinders effective communication. Stay flexible but proactive.


## Managing Multiple Interviewers Without Visual Cues 

While introductions were given, identifying who was asking questions over the phone proved challenging. Without video or even a visual cue like a name overlay, it’s easy to feel lost. 

Tip: If there are multiple interviewers, ask each person to state their name when speaking, especially if the call format is unexpected. Even something as simple as, “I appreciate the introductions! Could each person say their name when asking a question?” can make a big difference.


## Unclear Audio or Background Noise 

Virtual interviews are susceptible to technical difficulties like unclear audio or distracting background noises. This not only makes it hard to focus but can also lead to miscommunication. 

Tip: Politely ask for clarification if audio is unclear, and make sure to use noise-canceling headphones and a stable connection on your end. Don’t be afraid to say, “Could you please repeat that? The audio was unclear.”


## Resume Overlooked or Misunderstood 

It became clear that my interviewers hadn’t reviewed my resume closely, likely due to the virtual format. This led to redundant questions and seemed to create frustration when I didn’t provide immediate answers. 

Tip: Use references to your resume to guide the conversation. Phrases like, “As noted in my resume, I handled X…” provide a subtle reminder of your background while keeping the conversation on track.


## Unexpectedly Basic or Keyword-Focused Questions 

Instead of asking broader questions about my expertise, I was asked questions that felt overly basic—more like knowledge every layout designer should have. It felt as though the interviewers were expecting specific keywords. 

Tip: When you’re asked questions that seem overly basic or technical, answer confidently while incorporating relevant context. You might say, “Yes, following X practice is standard, and I also integrate [related approach] to ensure compliance.” This keeps you in control without undermining your expertise.


## Struggling to Interpret Reactions Without Video 

One of the trickiest parts of virtual interviews is the lack of body language and facial expressions, which help gauge reactions. Without visual cues, it’s easy to feel disconnected or uncertain about your responses. 

Tip: In the absence of video, focus on tone and pacing. Speak clearly and confidently, and don’t hesitate to ask questions like, “Does that answer your question?” to ensure clarity.


## Feeling Rushed or Pressured

The primary interviewer seemed somewhat impatient when I didn’t provide the exact answer he was looking for, which threw me off. Virtual interviews can amplify these feelings since non-verbal cues are missing.

Tip: Remember, you’re there to discuss your unique perspective. Take a deep breath and say, “Let me clarify my experience with X,” or “If that’s not the angle you’re looking for, I’d be happy to adjust.”


## Final Thoughts

Virtual interviews can feel like navigating a maze of technical challenges, unclear communication, and unfamiliar formats. If you’ve had similar experiences, remember that it’s not a reflection of your value. Approach each interview as a learning experience, and don’t hesitate to share feedback when appropriate—virtual interviews are still evolving, and a better experience benefits everyone.
