I didn’t just work in semiconductors—I grew up in it. My dad was a mask designer, beginning in the rubylith and punch card days. I remember the long nights when he would head into the office to check on runs—especially as tape-in deadlines approached. This was long before you could just log in from home. I remember the giant plotters. And most of all, I remember his study.

That room was serious business. He’d be drawing, lines of every color laid down with mechanical Pentel pencils. As a kid, I didn’t understand what any of it meant. It just looked like coloring. But I grew up and realized: he was designing circuits. He was helping shape the future.

His work wasn’t just technical—it was historic. He contributed to the design of circuitry used in one of the early digital watches now housed in the Smithsonian, and played a role in the navigation systems tied to the Apollo program. At the time, I didn’t know how rare that was. Now I do.

Two of my siblings also became mask designers, as did my husband, who transitioned into Physical Design Engineering later in his career. The third sibling went into education—special education—and spent years rolling her eyes at the rest of us for getting excited over IC layout, new process nodes, and all the technical challenges we faced in the industry. But for us, it wasn’t just a job. It was a language we all spoke. A way of thinking. And a kind of pride that’s hard to explain if you haven’t lived it.

We followed the silicon—from Texas to California, to Arizona, back to California, and eventually back to Texas. Full circle. It wasn’t just a job move—it was a lifestyle. Almost like being a military brat. Only instead of bases, we chased fabs.

## The Art of Layout

Mask design—especially analog layout—is a discipline that blends logic, intuition, and craftsmanship. I’ve come to believe that if you can succeed as an analog mask designer—especially in high-speed, high-complexity designs—you can handle anything this field throws at you.

The level of consideration required is immense. Every connection, every decision has cascading effects. And the mental load of keeping all that in focus while balancing DRC, matching, shielding, spacing, routing strategy, current flow, and signal integrity is not for the faint of heart.

Compared to that, other types of layout work are more manageable. Not easier—just different. Analog designers earn their stripes. And those who’ve done it well, year after year, deserve real respect.

What’s frustrating is how invisible the role is. Most people don’t even know what a layout designer is. We’re constantly mistaken for circuit designers or electrical engineers. But we’re our own specialization—our own discipline—and the job is far more niche and critical than it gets credit for.

## What We’re Losing

Mask design has always been a quiet discipline. It’s technical, tedious, and misunderstood by just about everyone outside of it. But lately, it feels like it’s being erased in real time.

One of the more troubling signs is how few junior mask design roles I see anymore. Almost every posting is for a senior or staff-level designer—someone expected to walk in and run. There’s no on-ramp. No training. No passing of the torch. And when you don’t invest in bringing people in, the field doesn't evolve—it withers.

Some will argue that’s fine. That AI and correct-by-construction tools will eliminate the need for layout cleanup. That we don’t need more layout designers at all.

I’ve heard that before—many times over the years. But the truth is, even with every advancement in automation, you still need someone to look at the block and think critically. You still need a human brain—one that’s seen enough to spot the subtle problems a tool won’t flag. Routing tools still miss. Constraints get misapplied. There are judgment calls a script just can’t make. At the end of the day, layout still needs eyes on it—experienced eyes.

What’s worse is how some companies treat layout like a box to check. I’ve seen highly capable designers—people who carry whole projects on their shoulders—let go when budgets get tight. The assumption is that the work can just be handed off to a contractor in a low-cost geo. Sometimes that works out. Sometimes it doesn’t. The problem is, you usually don’t know until something breaks.

And when you’re dealing with contractor churn—people who are overworked, undervalued, and siloed from the rest of the team—there’s often no ownership. No context. No skin in the game. You might save on paper, but you lose in quality, time, and accountability.

What we’re really losing isn’t just layout talent—it’s layout judgment. The kind that takes decades to build. The kind that keeps tape-in on track, quietly, without drama. And once it’s gone, there’s no easy way to get it back.

## A Quiet Warning

This isn’t just a reflection. It’s a warning.

I’m one of the people still here—still looking for the next role, still willing to do the work. But it’s getting harder to even get in the door. The ATS systems weed you out for reasons that have nothing to do with competence. I’ve watched my resume disappear into the void more times than I can count—because I didn’t hit the right keyword combination or some job title didn’t match an internal template.

Even when I do get through, I’m often talking to recruiters who don’t understand what I actually do. And I don’t blame them—it’s a tough job. But I’ve had conversations with technical recruiters who couldn’t tell the difference between a mask designer, a circuit designer, and a physical design engineer. Those roles are not interchangeable, but the keyword soup in the job descriptions makes them sound like they are.

It’s frustrating. Because layout isn’t filler work. It’s not a nice-to-have. It’s the last line of defense between a great design and a silicon disaster.

I’m not asking for the past back. I know the industry’s changing. But layout deserves to evolve—not disappear. It deserves better than being outsourced without oversight or buried under tool flows that promise automation but still need human hands to clean up the mess.

Layout is quiet work. Most people don’t even know it exists. But it’s disappearing—fading instead of evolving. I just hope the industry remembers what it had before it’s too late to bring it back.
